# facebook-data

This repository holds the posts we collected from March 1, 2020, to March 1,
2021 from various Facebook groups and pages we found to be vaccine hesitant.
It is split into four different groups because we did two rounds of
acquisition for pages and groups separately.

Exploratory data analysis is done in a Google colaboratory.
